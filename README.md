# A R G H M A N I A

A very limited and scuffed 4-key mania clone of sorts. Has the barebones features of what you'd expect: gameplay with scoring and metrics as well as an editor.

I basically gave myself a week and a half (and no more!) to get this project from the barest of the barebones to something that at least looks polished. So, while it works, there are certainly many other things that it could use. These include but are not limited to:

- Rankings (e.g. SS, S, A, B, ...)
- Non-linear time interpolated animations (and more animations in general to make the rhythm more felt)
- A GUI-based editor
- Keybinds for the editor (would improve UX by a TON!)
- Search feature for beatmaps
- Center selected beatmaps in the main menu (would help with selected beatmaps that are nearly offscreen)
- Audio controls
- Keybind settings
- Visual design hinting for controls (especially on mobile - yes it works there but for on all screens!)
- Truly responsive UI (does not work for smaller screens, though you're crazy if you play these games on a portrait-oriented screen)
- Many code architecture fixes and adjustments (hehe)

## Controls and Features

DFJK to hit the notes from leftmost to rightmost, respectively. For touch devices, the leftmost part of the screen corresponds to the leftmost column of notes, and so on.

Beatmaps can be both imported (in the main menu) and exported (in the edit beatmap screen) as JSON files.
